### The repository for all code concerned with the paper, "Fail-tests of DNA methylation clocks, and development of a noise barometer for measuring epigenetic pressure during biological aging."

To download all data used in analysis, run the script `download-all-data.sh` - held in the
`scripts` folder. Since we used several GBs worth of data, downloading the required
files will take a little bit of time.

We make extensive use of the well-known tool, Jupyter Notebooks. More information can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/).

For any questions at all regarding code in this repository, please email `jeblanchard@berkeley.edu` or
`mei.serafina@berkeley.edu`.
